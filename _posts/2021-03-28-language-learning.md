(Naturally) continued to forget about my github. Renamed my git username and then forgot I should've renamed my github 
pages repo as well.

Experimenting with educative since I saw an ad during the AOC and went with C++ because I have a raspberry pi 4 and
the work involved in setting up python on an aarch64 architecture was so annoying and most of the C++ tools were already
in place that I just went with C++ (with that said, I got most of python set up anyway). While I like the fact that 
educative skips over the video lecture entirely (never been a strong fan of that in MOOCs), so far think the 
educative exercises could be beefed up. Admittedly I'm not that far in the C++ module because I've been pretty lazy 
even though the early going is pretty straightforward since operators are pretty much all the same regardless of 
language.
